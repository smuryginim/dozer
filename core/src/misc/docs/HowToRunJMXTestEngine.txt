  1.  Add misc/jmx-testengine/JMXTestEngine to your dozer eclipse project src.  Doesn't matter where.  The java file doesnt have a package so it just needs to be in root
  2.  Using jdk1.5, run JMXTestEngine with the following VM arg set --> -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote
  3.  Open a dos window and run jconsole.  i.e) C:\Sun\AppServer\jdk\bin>jconsole
  4.  When jconsole opens, select the JMXTestEngine process and click connect.  Go to the mbeans tab and you should see the 2 dozer mbeans
